**So You Want To Spend Money With A Discount**
-

Hello and welcome to this boring guide with no pictures. If you read through it you'll learn how to save 10-20-30% of your raid spend. 

First of all, hope you all are spending what you can afford to and all that rot. 
Second, I'm going to assume that you want to get more bang for your buck. If you don't, plarium executives will surely be extremely happy.

If you want to say thanks, please use my promo code AXJNAUEQ (valid until 2026-02-03). 

**What Do I Get**

A cashback to the aptoide wallet off each purchase. Said cashback you can subsequently spend on more purchases.

How much cashback? 2-20% base (realistically: 6-10%) + 5% extra from a promo code + 5-10% extra on specific days. That adds up quickly!

**The Fuck Is Aptoide And Why This Is Not A Scam**

Aptoide is an application store that tries to eat google's market share, so they are doing what they can to attract users. Profit from it while it lasts, ditch aptoide afterwards with no regrets.

Brother, you're shit out of luck. 

If you're a low spender, probably no need to bother. 

If you spend \$100-200 a month or more, consider getting a cheap used laptop for \$200 in your local marketplace group or off a friend or something like that, it will both improve your raid experience thanks to the rsl helper and optimizer access and give you access to android emulation.
